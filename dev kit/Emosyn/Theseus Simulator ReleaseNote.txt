Additional Instructions:

*   The Save or Restore debug session options are only available for selection once the debug session is running 
    and if the simulator is Halted.
    To Restore a previously saved session, start debugger, go to peripheral menu->Restore Debug Session
    and select the relevant file with a .sds file extension. On restoring a debug session in paddleboard mode
    set the reset and Vcc high before pressing Run. The ATR will not be sent again unless you reset. 
    To Save your current debug session, Halt the simulator but do not stop the debugger, 
    Select Peripheral menu->Save Debug Session. You can overwrite an existing .sds file or create a new one.

**  To start the simulation in paddle board mode it is now necessary to press the run button on the debugger 
    menu or toolbar.
