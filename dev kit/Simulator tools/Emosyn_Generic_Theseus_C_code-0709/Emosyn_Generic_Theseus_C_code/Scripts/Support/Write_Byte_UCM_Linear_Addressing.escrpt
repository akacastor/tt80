; Generic script that writes a byte value to UCM space in Linear Addressing mode
; (3 byte addressing, over 64K address range)
; 
; 1. Set the DPX value in the chip to the correct start value
; 2. Read UCM area checking it is all FFh
; 3. Set the DPX value in the chip to the correct start value
; 4. Write 00h to the entire UCM space excluding the generic software code
; 5. Set the DPX value in the chip to the correct start value
; 6. Read back entire area checking all bytes are now 00h
