;  Test starts at block3 as the Generic as code finishes before this point
;  Last block not tested as bootloader resides here

;  WARNING
;
;  THE Erase_UCM_Blocks__R6R7_Passing APDU WILL ALWAYS RETURN 9000
;  NO CHECKS ARE MADE IN FIRMWARE TO SEE IF ANY BLOCKS FAILED TO ERASE
;  ALSO THE STATE MACHINE ALWAYS RETURNS SUCCESS IN THE NVFSMCON SFR

; TT30 Set Protect & Erase UCM blocks test
; 1. Loads in TT30 memory defaults
; 2. Offers user selection of terminal to run the scripter at
; 3. Gets the ATR and compares it to the expected preset ATR value
; 4. Loads in APDU commands values
; 5. Ensure 3400h to 7800h is clear
; 6. Write 55 AA 55 AA 55 AA 55 AA to block boundaries
; 7. Protect block 3400 – 3BFF, 5400 – 63FF & 7400 – 77FF
; 8. Attempt to erase blocks 3 to 8
; 9. Read back block boundary data, protected blocks should have data intact
; 10. Reset the chip, it should lose the temporary set protect settings
; 11. Erase blocks 3 through to block 8
; 12. Write 55 AA 55 AA 55 AA 55 AA to block boundaries
; 13. Protect block 3400 – 3BFF, 5400 – 63FF & 7400 – 77FF permanently
; 14. Attempt to erase blocks 3 to 8
; 15. Read back block boundary data, protected blocks should have data intact
